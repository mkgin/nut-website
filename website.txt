Welcome
=======

The primary goal of the Network UPS Tools (NUT) project is to provide support
for Power Devices, such as Uninterruptible Power Supplies, Power Distribution
Units, Automatic Transfer Switches, Power Supply Units and Solar Controllers.
NUT provides a common protocol and set of tools to monitor and manage such
devices, and to consistently name equivalent features and data points, across
a vast range of vendor-specific protocols and connection media types.

NUT provides many control and monitoring link:features.html[features], with a
uniform control and management interface. If you are just getting acquainted
with NUT, link:features.html[that page] also explains the technical design
and some possible set-ups.

More than 170 different manufacturers, and several thousands of models are
link:stable-hcl.html[compatible].

# Models:

.Two NUT websites
====
The link:https://networkupstools.org/[main NUT site] should closely follow
current development, with documentation most relevant for users who build NUT
from link:https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/[source code].

link:https://networkupstools.org/historic/[Sub-sites] are available for some
historic releases for users of NUT packaged with their operating system
distributions. Such packages are typically based on official releases of
NUT at the time of distribution, and may lag behind current development
in terms of features, capabilities, bug-fixes and supported devices.

Some data, such as devices with known support at the time of release, are
published to reflect both current development and historic releases; other
data such as the NUT DDL or source archives are release-agnostic and only
published once and for all.
